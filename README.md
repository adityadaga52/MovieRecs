# MovieRecs
My first personal project. Here, I've used Jupyter, Python, and Pandas to create a system that allows users to type the name of a movie into an input box and instantly get recommendations for other movies they might like.

I cleaned movie title data (via regex) and implemented a search function (using a tfidf matrix). I integrated an interactive search box in Jupyter and incorporated movie ratings data to identify users with similar preferences. I calculated recommendation scores, built a recommendation function, and finalized the project with an interactive recommendation widget for seamless user experience. 

I've followed a tutorial from @Dataquest on YouTube.
